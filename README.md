## Background and Purpose

We want to support Robin, a junior data scientist who based on her passion takes up a project to gather data about the mission to mars and try to place all the results of her searches for the latest news and updates in a central location.

Essentially, we are crafting webapplication to scrape said information for her so she doesn't have to do the data collection manually (just imagine how much could show up!). Then we will have our program deposit the information to mongo db, a document based database capable of receiving all the paragraphs, images, and other data we might be able to retrieve (or "scrape"). Finally, using a flask app we want to create a simple
webframework (with html and css). The idea is that Robin and other mars enthusiasts can revisit this tool and get updated information on demand.

EDIT - still running into errors with the flask and thus unable to render images right now
